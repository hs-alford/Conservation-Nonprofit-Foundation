# TreeHuggers_WebApplication

Project to create a web applicaiton for a nonprofit organization.

Name of the organizaiton is Treehuggers Forest Conservation. The web app was created using primarily using C#/ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio. To access the non-public parts of the web app, a user must create an account and log in. There are three types (or levels) of users: Member, Staff, and Admin. Each level has access to different parts and functions of the web app.

The admin has full crud access in the applicaiton, it's users, and their roles. Staff have their own section with read access various, reports, limited full data access, and other functions. Regualr memebers have their own seperate part of the web app, with access to their personal account data and other information a "member" of a nonprofit foundation would usually be able to view.
